# Design Brief
For my design and technology project I am making an internal ordering system or a café. It will provide an easy process for employees to keep track of customer orders. 

This system will be used by employees of the café. The system will provide a frontend for the cashiers that is simple and easy to use. The display for the chefs will clearly display what the customers have ordered and allow to keep track of what is ready.  



The technologies that i am using are node.js with the express socket.io and pug modules.
